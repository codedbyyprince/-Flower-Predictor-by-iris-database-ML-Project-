Iris Flower Predictor

This is my first machine learning project, where I built a model to predict the species of the Iris flower based on its physical characteristics.

I created this project using Scikit-learn, one of Python’s most popular machine learning libraries. Along the way, I learned how to:

Collect and prepare data

Train a model

Test and evaluate its accuracy

This project was both challenging and rewarding. I faced moments of trial—like understanding feature selection and tuning the model—but overcoming them gave me practical insight into how machine learning works.

Project Highlights

Uses the classic Iris dataset

Implements a predictive model with Scikit-learn

Tested and validated the model’s accuracy

Designed to be readable, extendable, and easy to follow for learners

This project represents the first step in my journey to mastering machine learning. The focus here was not just to build a working model, but also to understand the logic behind the predictions.
